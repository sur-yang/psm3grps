**Extending the Classical Propensity Score Matching Algorithm for Three-Group Datasets**

## Introduction

The psm3grps package innovatively extends the classical propensity score matching (PSM) algorithm to datasets featuring three distinct groups.

The key features include:

Goal: Implements 1-1-1 PSM among three treatment groups.
Scores: Uses Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) via multinomial logistic regression, producing a probability score vector for each individual's group belonging.
Data Processing: Applies the rectangular common support region method to refine the sample, followed by GPS recalculation.
Matching: Adopts Lopez's vector matching method:
a. Select a reference group, perform k-means clustering with the other groups.
b. Conduct matching with replacement within clusters, using the reference groupâ€™s score.
c. Iterate steps with different reference groups.
d. Include individuals matched in all datasets for final analysis.

## Basic usage

```R
rm(list=ls())
data("exampleData",package="psm3grps")

# check unbalanced dataset
compareGroups::descrTable(treat~.,method = 4,data = exampleData)

# run the code
df.psm<-psm3grps(dataset)

# check the result
compareGroups::descrTable(treat~.,method = 4,data = df.psm)
```
